<h1>Hand Tracking using MediaPipe and OpenCV</h1>

<p>This project utilizes OpenCV and MediaPipe to perform hand tracking using a webcam. It detects hands in real-time and draws landmarks and connections on the detected hands.</p>

<p>The program captures video from the webcam, processes the frames to detect hand landmarks, and visualizes the detected hands with lines connecting the key points on the hand. The hand tracking functionality is provided by MediaPipe's pre-trained model.</p>
